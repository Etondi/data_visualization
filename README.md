## Project Overview
This project focuses on visualizating the Airbnb market to identify the best location for purchasing a property and renting it out.

## Data Sources
The dataset used in this project was obtained from [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/).

## Tools
- **Tableau**: For data visualization

## Objective
The objective is to provide a dashboard to help a client make an informed decision about where to buy a property by examining factors such as location, number of bedrooms, potential revenue, and competition.

## Visualization
The dashboard contains several key visualizations:
1. **Average Price per Bedroom**: A bar chart showing the average price for properties with different numbers of bedrooms.
2. **Price by Zipcode**: A map and bar chart illustrating the average price per zipcode.
3. **Revenue for Year**: A line graph showing the cumulative revenue throughout the year.

### Key Observations from Visualizations
- **Average Price per Bedroom**: 
  - Properties with more bedrooms tend to have higher average prices, peaking at 6 bedrooms.
  - The price increases significantly from 4 to 6 bedrooms, however having 7 bedrooms has a lower average price than 6.
- **Price by Zipcode**:
  - Prices vary significantly by zipcode, with some areas showing much higher average prices than others.
  - This variation will help identify the most and least expensive areas.
- **Revenue for Year**:
  - The revenue graph shows an upward trend, indicating a growing market or increasing demand over the year.
  - Seasonal fluctuations may also be visible, which can help in planning the best times to list the property.

## Findings
- **Best Locations**: Identified neighborhoods with the highest average prices and potential revenue based on zipcode analysis.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Revenue trends suggest the best times to list properties to maximize occupancy and profit.
- **Price Drivers**: The number of bedrooms and location are key factors influencing the price of Airbnb listings.
- **Competitive Landscape**: Understanding the price distribution across zip codes provides insights into the competitive market.

## Recommendations
- **Optimal Property Size**: Consider purchasing properties with 4-6 bedrooms for higher average rental prices.
- **Location Selection**: Focus on high-demand zip codes with higher average prices to maximize revenue potential.
- **Listing Strategy**: Leverage the revenue trend data to list the property during peak times for maximum occupancy and profit.
- **Market Positioning**: Analyze competitive pricing strategies in targeted zip codes to ensure competitive yet profitable pricing.
